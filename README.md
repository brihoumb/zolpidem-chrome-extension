# Zolpidem Chrome-Extension #
Zolpidem is a free and open-source extension for Google Chrome to free ram when using lot of tabs.  
It acts like the great suspender but in a cheap version.  
#### Before upgrading the extension you **must** export your tabs or unsuspend them otherwise you will lose them! ####

## How to use the extension: ##
### Commands: ###
You can bind your own shortcuts at `chrome://extensions/shortcuts`.

### Pop-up: ###
On the top right corner you will have a pop-up (or in the little puzzle piece).  
![pop-up](documentation/popup.png)  
You can suspend the current tab with the üí§ button, all other tabs with üåô and wake all tabs with üåû.  
This pop-up allows you to export your tabs and their group in a JSON file called `session.json`.  
You can then import your tabs by either drag&drop your JSON onto the `Choose a file` button **or** by selecting it by clicking on the button.  
The tabs are opened on a new window to avoid overloading your current window.  

## Suspended tab: ##
To restor a suspended tab you can either click anywhere on the window or hit ctrl+r or f5.

*A suspended tab shows you it's title and the URL suspended.*
